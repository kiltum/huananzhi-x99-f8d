The manual is enough to start to use the motherboard

## Comments

- When board first start it stop on B7 code. Even if battery just installed, you need switch "Clear RTC" to on and off
- If the boot code B7 appear again, it's related with RAM bad connection, need to verify, get off and put again, retry this until work, the best memory I buy is developed by Crucial.
- There are a lot of problems related to bad connection of memory.
- Board Boot time is HUGE when using 2 processors! It's a little better when using 1 processor.
- Sleep & Resume do not work
